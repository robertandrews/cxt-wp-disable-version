## Description

Improve security and file caching issues by disabling display of WordPress version.

### 1. Disable 'generator' meta

WordPress shows its version number in mark-up.

> Many believe that removing the WordPress version number from your websiteâ€™s source code can prevent some common online attacks. -- [WPBeginner](https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/the-right-way-to-remove-wordpress-version-number/)

The plugin stops this version number being displayed.

### 2. Disable version for style.css

WordPress appends its version number to stylesheets.

This may make caching and reload of style.css problematic.

The plugin stops this version number being added.
